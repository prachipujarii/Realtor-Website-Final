          <li>Short Term Capital Gain also known as STCG</li>

        <p className="text-base mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Long Term Capital Gains on real estate is applicable on properties held for a minimum period of 3 years; in the last union budget of 2017 the same has been reduced to 2 years, however there are certain provisions in the act for older properties, which shall be computed for 3 years.
